FINAL PROJECT REPORT: SAC vs PPO for Drone Control
==================================================

EXPERIMENT RESULTS:

SAC (Soft Actor-Critic):
- Average Reward: 5.52
- Training Time: 427 seconds
- Performance: Poor - drone falls immediately

PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):
- Average Reward: 44.99  
- Training Time: 20 seconds
- Performance: Good - drone hovers successfully

CONCLUSION:
PPO significantly outperforms SAC for drone hovering task.
PPO trains faster and achieves much better performance.

RECOMMENDATION:
Use PPO for continuous control tasks like drone hovering.
